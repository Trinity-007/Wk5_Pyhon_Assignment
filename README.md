# Python Assignment - Classes and Polymorphism

This repo contains my solutions for the **Python Object-Oriented Programming Assignment**.  

## Contents
`assignment.py` → Main Python file with class implementations  

## Features
**Custom Class Design** → Created a class with attributes, methods, and constructors  
**Inheritance** → Demonstrated parent-child class relationships  
**Polymorphism** → Implemented different `move()` behaviors for multiple classes (e.g., Car, Plane, etc.)
